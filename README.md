#Notes
This is a game that lets you match scripture chapter summaries with their chapter names. Comments and suggestions welcome.

To get the app working, you will need to have node installed. Cd to the directory where you downloaded the app, and run 'npm install.'

Go into server.js, and change this line: nodeApp.use(express.static('C:\\Path\\To\\ServerJs\\Folder')) with the path to the folder where server.js lives.

To use start.bat, open a text editor (like Notepad) and replace "C:\path\to\server.js" with the path to server.js (i.e., the folder path where you downloaded the app).
